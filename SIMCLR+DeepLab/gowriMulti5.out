GPU 0: Tesla K80 (UUID: GPU-88f6fad0-73af-21b5-62cf-86ff04e9131c)

Jupyter server is running on: gpu-01
Job starts at: Wed Apr 29 20:30:13 EDT 2020

Step 1 :

If you are working in NYU campus, please open an iTerm window, run command

ssh -L 8223:localhost:8223 sga297@prince.hpc.nyu.edu

If you are working off campus, you should already have ssh tunneling setup through HPC bastion host, 
that you can directly login to prince with command

ssh sga297@prince

Please open an iTerm window, run command

ssh -L 8223:localhost:8223 sga297@prince

Step 2:

Keep the iTerm windows in the previouse step open. Now open browser, find the line with

The Jupyter Notebook is running at: gpu-01

the URL is something: http://localhost:8223/?token=XXXXXXXX (see your token below)

you should be able to connect to jupyter notebook running remotly on prince compute node with above url
