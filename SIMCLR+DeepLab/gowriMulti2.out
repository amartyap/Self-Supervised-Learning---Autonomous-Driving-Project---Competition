ssh -L 6188:localhost:6188 sga297@prince.hpc.nyu.edu

If you are working off campus, you should already have ssh tunneling setup through HPC bastion host, 
that you can directly login to prince with command

ssh sga297@prince

Please open an iTerm window, run command

ssh -L 6188:localhost:6188 sga297@prince
